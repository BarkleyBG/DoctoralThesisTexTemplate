This is an example of dissertation format of Noorie Hyun Ph.D.in Biostatistics; The paper based on the style file and template was approved by the graduate school in May 2014. I'm grateful to many authors, who shared their thesis style, and I was so surprised about the long history of the style file as you can see the annotations; particularly, I've directly got some idea and advice from style files of Drs. Chaeryon Kang, Dustin Long, Naomi Chana Brownstein, David Kessler, and Baiming Zou.


The format is acceptable according to the Dissertation guideline of 2014; however, there is still a problem to solve:

In page of "Table of Contents",
 
• The entries for List of Tables and List of Figures should not be indented. They should be aligned to the left with the chapter numbers.

(Note: the submitted version was well aligned, but this template file has the issue.) 

Good luck for your dissertation!!
