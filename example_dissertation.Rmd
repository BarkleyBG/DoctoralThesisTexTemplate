# Introduction

This is an example thesis .Rmd template, which, when compiled, uses the `UNC_thesis_template.tex` file to create both a `.tex` file and a `.pdf` file.

NOTE: `UNC_thesis_template.tex` is under development and does NOT (yet) meet the UNC graduate school guidelines.

# Chapter 2

One could put all the text in a single `.Rmd` file.

# Chapter 3

```{r, child='example_child.Rmd'}
```

## How to make Citations 

You cite articles using `rmarkdown` syntax (google rmarkdown for helpful hints). For example, @halmos1970howto is a good text read. Or writing about mathematics is challenging [@halmos1970howto].
